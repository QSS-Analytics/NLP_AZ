This repo shows the implementation of loading the word embeddings via Keras for text classification (binary but you can build a model for multiclass class-n as well).

Examples will be provided both for R and Python notebooks.

[AUC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic#Area_under_the_curve) in our example with a few epochs on a small data is ~ 0.98.
